# TODO

Roadmap items for the wlanpi-chat-bot module.

# Short-term

 - Flush any waiting messages if we have just (re)booted. This can cause boot loops.
 - Provide help option to list all commands that start with one of more letters, e.g. "help s" would show all set and show commands.
 - Create user guide

# Medium 

- Add more features based on API calls to wlanpi-core

# Long-term
