# User Guide for WLAN Pi Chat-Bot

## Overview
The WLAN Pi chat-bot is a Telegram bot that allows a number of remote operations to be performed on a WLAN Pi that has Internet connectivity. These include operations such as checking the status of the WLAN Pi and running tests such and speedtest and ping.

There are three steps to configure the chat-bot:

 - Create a Telegram account and install the Telegram application on a mobile device
 - Configure yourself a bot on Telegram (this will be your WAN Pi bot)
 - Configure an API key on the WLAN Pi to allow it to talk to your Telegram bot

These steps are detailed in the Set-up section below.

Once the bot is operational, there are a number of commands that can be executed to obtain information and execute various tests and operations. This is covered in the Using Chat-bot section below.
