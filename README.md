# wlanpi-chat-bot

Chat bot for the WLAN Pi project

*** Note that this code is still under development ***

# Debian Package Build/Install

```
# Build the deb package
git clone https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/wlanpi-chat-bot.git
cd wlanpi-telegram-bot
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

# The deb package is here
cd ..

# Install the package
sudo dpkg -i wlanpi-chat-bot_1.0.0_armhf.deb 

# Configure your Telegram API key and restart twice (so that Chat ID is obtained and you receive a new status message from the bot)
sudo nano /opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/etc/config.json
sudo systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot; sleep 5; sudo systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot 

# Uninstall the package while keeping the Chat Bot config file with your API key
sudo dpkg -r wlanpi-chat-bot

# Remove the package completely including Chat Bot config file with your API key
sudo dpkg -P wlanpi-chat-bot
```
# Configure Chat-Bot

1. Create a new Telegram account if you do not have one already. Start the Telegram app.
2. Letâ€™s create a new Telegram bot. Find a person called Botfather and send them a message saying /newbot.
3. Follow the instructions to create a new bot.
4. After the new bot is created, copy the API key to a text editor.
5. Edit the file `/opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/etc/config.json` and enter your API key in to the the "bot_token" field:

```
{
    "telegram": {
        "bot_token": "1233735614:AAHe9eHOP_uCe6773bWjQTNvHT_llYHmFSw",
        "chat_id": "",
        "display_mode": "full",
        "display_width": "30",
        "yaml_cmds": "/opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/wlanpi_commands/yaml"
    }
}
```
6. Restart the chat service to read the updated configuration file:

```
systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot
```
7. In Telegram, send a message to the newly created bot (e.g. show status), this will provide the bot with the chat_id it needs to start communicating. You may have to do this a couple of times to kick it into life. Once the bit is responding, you're good go. You don't need to do this again, it's a one-time operation.
8. Send the bot a "?" to see the commands available to you. Have fun :)
