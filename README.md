## Debian Packaging

If you'd like to build the Debian package yourself, review the following instructions.

Install build depends:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential debhelper devscripts equivs python3-pip python3-all python3-dev python3-setuptools dh-virtualenv
```

Install Python depends so that the tooling doesn't fail when it tries to evaluate which tests to run.

```bash
python3 -m pip install mock
```

Clone and install the package:

```bash
# Build the deb package
git clone https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/wlanpi-chat-bot.git
cd wlanpi-telegram-bot
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

# The deb package is here
cd ..

# Install the package
sudo apt install ./wlanpi-chat-bot_1.0.0_armhf.deb 

# Configure your Telegram API key
sudo nano /opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/etc/config.json

# Restart twice so that Chat ID is obtained and you receive a new status message from the bot
sudo systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot; sleep 5; sudo systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot 

# Uninstall the package while keeping the Chat Bot config file with your API key
sudo apt remove wlanpi-chat-bot

# Remove the package completely including Chat Bot config file with your API key
sudo apt purge wlanpi-chat-bot
```

## Configure Chat-Bot

1. Create a new Telegram account if you do not have one already. Start the Telegram app.
2. Letâ€™s create a new Telegram bot. Find a person called Botfather and send them a message saying /newbot.
3. Follow the instructions to create a new bot.
4. After the new bot is created, copy the API key to a text editor.
5. Edit the file `/opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/etc/config.json` and enter your API key in to the the `"bot_token"` field:

```
{
    "telegram": {
        "bot_token": "1233735614:AAHe9eHOP_uCe6773bWjQTNvHT_llYHmFSw",
        "chat_id": "",
        "display_mode": "full",
        "display_width": "30",
        "yaml_cmds": "/opt/wlanpi-chat-bot/etc/commands"
    }
}
```

6. Restart the chat service to read the updated configuration file:

```bash
systemctl restart wlanpi-chat-bot
```

7. In Telegram, send a message to the newly created bot (e.g. show status), this will provide the bot with the chat_id it needs to start communicating. You may have to do this a couple of times to kick it into life. Once the bit is responding, you're good go. You don't need to do this again, it's a one-time operation.

8. Send the bot a "?" to see the commands available to you. Have fun :)
